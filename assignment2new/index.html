 <!-- i understand that the clicking on the image isnt entirely intuitive for the user but my intention was for it to be a cool little feature that the user can do if they explore, like an easter egg -->

             originally i was going to change the background of the container to another colour but realised it didnt have much colour contrast when i changed it to white/grey/cream (some elements on the page are already grey, some are a teal, and some are black. 
             making it white wouldn't have worked well with the teal and i did like the teal colour against the dark background) -->
