  <!-- This is a remix of my previous assignment (unintentionally!) 
 I ended up making a music player. Originally, my intent was to have an interactive timeline where I'd include two pages, and 5 songs per page and list each of the songs.
 Originally, I wanted to be able to hover over a song, it would increase in size slightly and show a 'see more' prompt, where the user would click to see more information.
 The more information has been put into the 'song details' section, and i've removed the action of hover, and focused solely on click, as it didn't make sense to include hover.
 The only section that includes a hover element is hovering over the buttons (which is very faint). However, because this is only a minor detail, I only count click as the main action throughout this project.
 -->

  <!-- I had the idea of including other elements like how long the song had been playing for, like this: https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/articles/049dBaMRI8i1mIJ6J2ADPAq-3..v1569486917.jpg 
  However, I wanted to stray further away from my previous assignment and make it more original. 
  I also didn't want it to become just a literal music player.

  <!-- My original idea was to change the UI of each year based on the evolution of the iPod OS but figured this would be too confusing for the user since there werenâ€™t any DRASTIC changes every single year in the OS and UI.
